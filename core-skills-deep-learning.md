# Data Science Roadmap 2025 - Core Skills: Deep Learning

## Deep Learning for Data Science

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that has revolutionized many areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

### Essential Skills

*   **Neural Networks Fundamentals:** Perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), activation functions, backpropagation.
*   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Architectures for image recognition and computer vision tasks.
*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Architectures for sequential data, including natural language processing (NLP) and time series analysis.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Techniques for text analysis, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and language generation.
*   **Computer Vision:** Image classification, object detection, image segmentation.

### Code Snippets (Python - TensorFlow/Keras)

#### Example: Simple CNN for Image Classification (using Keras)

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # 10 output classes (e.g., digits 0-9)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model summary
model.summary()

# Note: Training and evaluation would follow with appropriate datasets
```

#### Example: Simple RNN for Text Classification (using Keras)

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Model for text classification
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=64), # Example: vocab size of 10000
    layers.LSTM(64),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model summary
model.summary()

# Note: Training and evaluation would follow with appropriate text datasets
```

### Recommended Technologies

*   **TensorFlow:** Powerful open-source library for deep learning, developed by Google.
*   **PyTorch:** Open-source machine learning framework, popular for research and flexibility.
*   **Keras:** High-level API for building and training neural networks, runs on top of TensorFlow or other backends.
*   **TensorBoard:** Visualization toolkit for TensorFlow.
*   **Weights & Biases:** Experiment tracking and visualization platform.
*   **GPUs:**  Graphics Processing Units are highly recommended for training deep learning models.

### Resources

*   Online courses (e.g., DeepLearning.AI, MIT Deep Learning, fast.ai)
*   "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (comprehensive textbook)
