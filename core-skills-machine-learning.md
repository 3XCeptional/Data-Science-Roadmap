# Data Science Roadmap 2025 - Core Skills: Machine Learning

## Machine Learning for Data Science

Machine learning is a core skill for data scientists, enabling the development of models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

### Essential Skills

*   **Supervised Learning:** Regression (linear regression, polynomial regression), classification (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines).
*   **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
*   **Model Evaluation:** Metrics for regression and classification, cross-validation, bias-variance tradeoff.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Techniques for optimizing model parameters (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).

### Code Snippets (Python - Scikit-learn)

#### Example: Linear Regression

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

#### Example: K-Means Clustering

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3], [8, 7], [8, 8], [9, 7], [9, 8]])

# Train a K-Means model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0, n_init=10)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Get cluster labels and centroids
labels = kmeans.labels_
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

print(f'Cluster Labels: {labels}')
print(f'Centroids: {centroids}')
```

### Recommended Technologies

*   **Scikit-learn:** Comprehensive Python library for machine learning.
*   **TensorFlow:** Open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.
*   **PyTorch:** Open-source machine learning framework, popular for research and deep learning.
*   **XGBoost/LightGBM:** Gradient boosting frameworks for high-performance machine learning.
*   **Optuna:** Hyperparameter optimization framework.

### Resources

*   Online courses (e.g., fast.ai, Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp)
*   "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron
*   "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (more theoretical)
*   Scikit-learn documentation (scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Best Practices

*   Start with simpler models and gradually increase complexity.
*   Understand the assumptions and limitations of different algorithms.
*   Properly validate your models using appropriate techniques (cross-validation).
*   Focus on feature engineering and data preprocessing for better model performance.
*   Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameter settings.
