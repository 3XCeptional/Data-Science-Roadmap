# Data Science Roadmap 2025 - Core Skills: Machine Learning - Supervised Learning

## Supervised Learning: Learning with a Teacher üçé

Supervised learning is like having a teacher guide your learning process. You have labeled data, meaning you know the "right answers," and you train models to predict those answers for new, unseen data. Let's explore this fundamental ML approach!

### Essential Skills - Supervised Learning Techniques üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Regression:** Predicting continuous values.
    *   **Linear Regression:** Simple yet powerful for linear relationships.
    *   **Polynomial Regression:** For non-linear relationships, adding polynomial features.
*   **Classification:** Predicting categories or classes.
    *   **Logistic Regression:** For binary classification (two classes).
    *   **Decision Trees:** Tree-like models for both classification and regression.
    *   **Random Forests:** Ensemble of decision trees, robust and accurate.
    *   **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Powerful classifiers, especially effective in high-dimensional spaces.

### Code Snippets (Python - Scikit-learn) - Supervised Learning in Action üíª

#### Example: Linear Regression - Predicting House Prices üè†

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1000], [2000], [3000], [4000], [5000]])
y = np.array([200000, 400000, 500000, 400000, 500000])

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

#### Example: Logistic Regression - Spam Classification üìß

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Sample binary classification data (replace with real data for a real project!)
X = np.array([[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6]]) # Features
y = np.array([0,0,0,1,1]) # Labels (0 or 1, e.g., not spam/spam)


# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}') # How often is the classifier correct?
```

### Recommended Tools

*   **Scikit-learn:** Python library with comprehensive supervised learning algorithms.
*   **Statsmodels:** Python library for statistical modeling, including regression.

### Resources

*   Scikit-learn documentation (scikit-learn.org/stable/)
*   Online courses on Supervised Learning (Coursera, Udacity, DataCamp)
*   "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aur√©lien G√©ron

### Best Practices

*   Choose the right algorithm based on your data and problem type (regression vs. classification).
*   Preprocess your data: handle missing values, scale features.
*   Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics and cross-validation.
*   Understand the bias-variance tradeoff and avoid overfitting.
